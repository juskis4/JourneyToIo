# JourneyToIo
The project was developed for the "Nasa Space Apps 2021" Hackathon, by a team of 4 people. 
## High-Level project summary
Have you ever dreamed of going into space looking at the vast darkness pigmented with little stars through your spaceship? Do you want to explore space and go on adventures? Well, now it's possible! Travel to Mars and beyond with Journey to Io, an interactive cutting edge learning game. You can learn fun facts about mankind's final frontier, do real-life experiments in your spaceship, and take on thrilling space adventures (Doesn't that sound cool already?). Well, we have more in store for you in Journey to Io! Join us in Journey to Io to discover more about space!

## Detailed project description
We started with our audience in mind: 12 to 14-year-old teenagers. We aimed to introduce space to our audience in a fun and interactive way. We wanted to make it easier and more relaxing for them to understand and conceptualize space and space phenomenon. We also wanted to provide our audience with a tool to develop space awareness and cognitive skills to recognize and identify problems that our space scientists face or are working on. Ultimately, we wanted to make space fun for our audience.

## Why this project
Our project is aimed at middle school students, teenagers and anybody interested in space. Our goal is to make space accessible and fun to those who are under-represented, to the minorities and to those who find STEM boring. Presenting only facts can make a subject, especially a STEM subject, tedious. Not to mention, the difficulty of subjects like physics, mathematics, astronomy, robotics can easily make a student lose interest in it. Hence, we decided to come with a fun and interactive game. Our goal is to give rise to the curiosity and competitive streak of our audience through a series of adventures and challenges while at the same time promoting the learning component.

## How we addressed this challenge
To make studying less tedious, we approached the game project. While we were discussing the project, our research led us across many facts and phenomenons that were linked to each other, those that can marvel the reader's mind. That led to the idea of this game. In this project, we adopted an interactive text style. We made the challenges start from the very basics and then built other challenges on top of the previous ones. Our goal was to put the facts in such a way that users can't help but remember them and become more curious about them. Each quest was a building block. We also tried to include a thrilling component to all our challenges, first, to challenge the player's competitive streak and second, to make this game a better learning experience.

### How so?

The player will navigate through a series of life-threatening problems, and he(r) will have to perform tasks to stay alive. The main goal for them is "TO STAY ALIVE".

We went through NASA's database to figure what risks are involved in a space mission. We modelled our challenge tracks (right now, we have 155 of them!) based on these risks. While navigating through the challenges, the player will have to try to stay alive. And to stay alive, they will need to pick the hints and facts to clear the levels. (It's like a treasure hunt!)

Journey to Io is a journey that never ends! Through this project, we hope to invoke children's curiosity towards space and enhance their spatial awareness.

## How was this project developed?
The first episode of the story was written (called "Ship"). Moving forward the basic plan for the whole story was thought of and a selected episode (Episode 3: Botany) was written to have a working prototype of this project. Our team used "Twine Engine" to help accelerate the process of creating a working application. After exporting the application with "Ship" and "Botany", the HTML file was uploaded to a GitHub repository and hosted using GitHub Pages.
